    <h1>Aligning a Block of Content to the Right</h1>
    <p>
        You can use a DIV tag to align a block of content to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
        The content can include anything you like, including tables, images,
        lists, and so on. Note, however, that right-aligned lists often do
        not look very neat.
